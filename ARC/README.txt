use the script in this way:

Go in the project directory, inside the bin folder, where you can find the .class files.

Use this in Command line:

java Converter PATH_FOR_THE_INPUT_TXT_FILE

For example, if you have the input file on your C Drive callaed input.txt use this:

java Converter C:\input.txt

This is the ONLY way you can use the script!
